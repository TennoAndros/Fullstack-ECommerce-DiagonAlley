It serves as a learning resource to understand the integration of client and server technologies using RESTful principles and Strapi, Stripe along with other technologies.

## Contents

This repository consists of two main folders:

### 1. Client

The `client` folder contains the front-end of the application, developed using React, React Redux, MUI. It showcases the user interface and interactions of the Ecommerce app.

### 2. Server

The `server` folder contains the back-end of the application, built using Stripe, Strapi. It handles data storage, processing, and interaction with the client.
